      <li><em><strong>“Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life; dream of it; think of it; live on that idea. Let the brain, the body, muscles, nerves, every part of your body be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success, and this is the way great spiritual giants are produced.”</strong></em></li>
      <br>
      <li><em><strong>The greatest religion is to be true to your own nature. Have faith in yourselves.”</strong></em></li>
      <br>
      <li><em><strong>Strength is Life, Weakness is Death.</strong></em></li>
      <br>
      <li><em><strong>"Talk to yourself once in a day, otherwise you may miss meeting an intelligent person in this world."</strong></em></li>
      <br>
      <li><em><strong>"Truth can be stated in a thousand different ways, yet each one can be true."</strong></em></li>
